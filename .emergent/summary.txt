<product_requirements>
The primary objective was to build a beautiful, premium landing page offering massage services, specifically for the brand lolo bere. The page needed to focus on stress and relaxation and cater to benefits such as sports, stress, and life benefits. A critical design requirement was a sophisticated stone or black color scheme. Furthermore, the user explicitly requested to Add a section with price prestation.

The detailed design framework provided outlined stringent requirements for a premium, immersive visual experience, including:
- **Visual Language:** Dramatic color contrast, glass-morphism effects (12-24px blur), subtle multi-level shadows, rounded corners (12-24px for containers, 8px for smaller elements), z-index hierarchy, subtle hover animations, gradient overlays, responsive design, subtle parallax scrolling, and background grid/pattern textures.
- **Typography System:** Premium fonts (Playfair Display for headlines), dramatic type scale (72-96px headlines, 16-18px body), varied font weights (300, 400, 600, 800), optimal line heights (1.1 for headlines, 1.6 for body), letter-spacing adjustments, and subtle text animations.
- **Color Strategy:** Limited palette (primary, secondary, neutral dark/light, 1-2 highlight for CTAs), atmospheric gradients, color for hierarchy, and strategic color psychology.
- **Landing Page Components:** Specific sections including a Hero (full-screen, bold headline, CTA, abstract background, custom illustration), Features (SVG icons, animated reveal, benefit-focused descriptions), Social Proof (testimonial cards, customer photos, logo showcase, metrics), Call-to-Action areas (visually distinct, urgency, high-contrast buttons, minimal forms), FAQ (accordion design), Footer (two-tier, pre-footer CTA, secondary nav, contact, social media, legal, newsletter). The price prestation section was added based on user input.
